# Class 2
## Homework from last week
Who submitted and who hasn't? Any problems with using replit and slack? 
(Were you able to review the notes link?)

## Heat Event Revision
See [notes from last class](https://github.com/miyagi-sensei/twgss/blob/main/class1.md#heat-event-revision).

## Generating Primes
1. Optimizing and impact to runtime performance
2. Time Complexity basis
3. Sieve of Eratosthenes

## Reminder
- Going forward, do all the coding for this class inside the First Project you created last time. You have sent me the invite link and I have access to it.
- Demonstrate how to send the link to a file in your replit project
- Learn how to manage the folders and organize your code and homework neatly. Here are the [common Linux commands](https://github.com/miyagi-sensei/miyagi-academy/blob/master/README.md#common-linux-commands).
- Don't use the `Run` button in replit. Get used to compiling your code with `g++ code.cpp` and then run it with `./a.out`. That way you can have more files in the same project.
